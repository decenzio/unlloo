## 🌟 What is Unlloo?

**Unlloo** is an on-chain reputation protocol that rewards positive Web3 behavior with **trust, status, and access to exclusive DeFi features** — like **uncollateralized borrowing** and **reduced fees** on partner protocols.

In Web3, identity isn’t just a wallet address — it’s your actions. Unlloo aggregates and interprets your on-chain activity to calculate a **reputation score** that unlocks real-world DeFi benefits.

## 💡 Why Unlloo?

* 🧠 **On-Chain Reputation**: Track and reward governance participation, long transaction history, NFT holdings, POAPs, and more.
* 💸 **Uncollateralized Loans**: Just like traditional credit, access microloans without over-collateralizing.
* ⚡ **Real-Time DeFi Access**: Built with performance-first tools (Scaffold-ETH-2, Hardhat, Next.js, Vercel).
* 🔍 **Rich Data Layer**: Integrates Blockscout APIs to pull balances, NFTs, ENS names, and social signals.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Aggregation**
   We collect your wallet's on-chain activity (tokens, NFTs, DAOs, POAPs, etc.) via Blockscout’s APIs.

2. **Reputation Engine**
   Custom algorithms process this data to build a multidimensional **reputation profile**.

3. **Smart Contracts**
   Written in **Solidity** and deployed to **Flow Mainnet**, our contracts enable uncollateralized microloans for reputable users.

4. **Liquidity Pools**
   Live pools for **WETH**, **USDC**, **cbBTC**, and **UNLOO** let liquidity providers earn yield.
